you got to be effing kidding me. the perrin pages will help you find your calling, but do not be duped. cut down the woods they be erdos. text me i am making contact at the following number:albeniz dot eng  dot uci dot edu forward slash 314 dot html

your solution must include at least 3 functions written in matlab by you: the rot-13 encryptor/decryptor, a function that generates perrin numbers and a function that generates erdos-woods numbers. email them to me after you have texted me. extra credit is given to the first person who texts me and who emailed me the right code.

good luck!
